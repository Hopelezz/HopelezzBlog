description: Documenting my journey in creating this website.

  ## Motivation

  At the time of writing this I'm 3 month into my `Web Development` journey. Details of what I'm capable of can be found [About Me](aboutMe). If that link doesn't work I've either not created the About Me page or a custom 404 Page... they're still under construction. See [Things I want to Do](#things-i-want-to-do) for more details. _Not gonna lie, I just learned ho to make this link to a different header on the page._

  ```
  The header 
  [Things I want to Do](#things-i-want-to-do)

  ```

  If you are struggling with the idea of `How To` for something like this I hope I can inspires you with this journey. Admittedly, I'm winging it...enjoying the process. If I break something I try to learn why it broke and how to fix it.

  ## What Frameworks Does This Site Use?

  This is purely Astro at the time of writting this post. However, Astro natively supports every popular framework.

  - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
  - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
  - [Solidjs](https://solidjs.com/)
  - [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
  - [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)
  - [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
  - [Vanilla](https://www.javascript.com/)

  Meaning, if I wanted to come back later and add anything specific I could with little to no issues!

  This site started out with a basic [Blog template](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog?file=README.md). By comparing the two I hope you can see the potential of creating your own.

  ## The Start

  The first post I wrote actually started back in 2011 as a facebook post. My mom asked me one morning "[What is a Password Vault](1-password)". Now we're here in 2022 creating a blog. I started programming about 2 years prior learning C#. Shortly after that my roomate & my Co-worker both suggested I start learning Python. I ran through the course but had no decernable direction. I love writting in python. It feels the most intuitive to me. I created a [Card Game](https://replit.com/@Hopelezz/War?v=1) pretty much from scratch.
