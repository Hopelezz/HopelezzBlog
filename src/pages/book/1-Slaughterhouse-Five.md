### _Post-Post-Modernism_


I felt that the ending was abrupt and just fell off, but that's not the selling point of the story! I loved the wit and subtle humor that's sprinkled throughout the book. "and the Russians came and arrested everybody except for the two horses" or "This could be useful for Rocketry". So many fun nuggets of humor... but it's bittersweet when the next moment Vonnegut's talking about the real and serious harm that has been inflicted in our history....The grey undertone of the story and the mental illness in which his protagonist is wracked with. Where he's the sole survivor of a plane crash and how everyone he meets ends up dead. The telling of subtle people throughout the book in which Vonnegut describes and then they just...die... "So It Goes"
Vonnegut uses humor in a gentle way to present a very real and grim history. The part that has my spine tingling the most is the fact Vonnegut, a prisoner of WWII, survived the bombing of Dresden in the meat locker of a slaughterhouse.
