At the onset of the cold war, a plane full of schoolboys gets shot down over an uninhabited island where only the children survive. Doesn’t take long before the whimsical and imaginative boys start creating a hierarchy amongst themselves. 

>"He who holds the Conch shell has the authority to speak!"

So is the law of the tribe. Shortly thereafter, a system for life was set in motion. Children created a fire, started a camp, and with plenty of fruit to eat; life was good. It doesn't take long before all hell breaks loose amongst the children and their baser instincts start to take hold.

>“Maybe there is a beast… Maybe it’s only us.”

Golding’s writing conveys blood lust, panic, and chaos unlike any author I’ve read. The story starts off slow, but with each new chapter a climax that builds off the last; a crescendo up until the last chapter when the wave of emotions crash down and all is set right again. William Golding was awarded a Nobel Prize for this masterpiece of literature in 1983 and deserves every ounce of praise for his novel.
