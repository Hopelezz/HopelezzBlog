## The Martian by Andy Weir

10/10
_Science fiction_

A space expedition goes horribly wrong just after Sol 6 on the planet of Mars (The Antagonist). A sudden dust storm (Which realistically is implausible, but makes for great storytelling!) causes the team to evacuate, but Mark Watney (the ever loving protagonist of our story) gets impaled by a chunk of satellite and is presumed dead. As happenstances go he survives and struggles for survival on the planet that's constantly trying to kill him. Watney, a botanist and mechanical mastermind, has the skill set needed to survive on the treacherous planet, but for how long?

The story advances through update logs in a unique and comical fashion through Watneys optimistic perspective. Using his optimism Watney reshape his unfortunate situation and sheds light on his ever growing list of problems.

>I guess you could call it a `failure`, but I prefer the term `learning experience`.

He has this witty and charming personality that’s hard not to love as you read. Imagine if Castaway, Mission to Mars, Apollo 13, and Macgyver were to have a baby The Martian would be the outcome. With it’s near plausible circumstances and nearly accurate science The Martian offers the readers a much desired story that’s been begging to be told for centuries.

Side note: For those who’ve watched the Movie but have yet to read the book, I seriously encourage you read the book! The Movie shifts around some details and the book has a ton of humor that never made it to the movie.
