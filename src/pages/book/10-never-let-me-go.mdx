### _Melancholy, Fiction, Dystopic_

I went into this novel with expectations but was left with a sense of loss but in that good kind of way.
Never Let Me Go, is a novel of a woman telling her story; similar to an autobiography.

The book starts off:

>“There have been times over the years when I’ve tried to leave Hailsham behind when I’ve told myself I shouldn’t look back so much. But then there came a point when I just stopped resisting. It had to do with this particular donor I had once, in my third year as a carer; it was his reaction when I mentioned I was from Hailsham.”

Centered around a school called Hailsham for children similar to that of an orphanage with a tinge of a concentration camp. The school is removed from society, in fact, society wants as little to do with them. The school is a place where children are taught to be responsible and to be kind to each other. Trained in litterature and art.

In this retelling of Kathy's life, you get a sense of gloom and anxiety that pervades these children's lives even unbeknownst to them.
