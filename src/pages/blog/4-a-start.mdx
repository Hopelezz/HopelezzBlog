Here I am with a freshly minted Blog using the Astro template. It's rather plain and doesn't have any content fetures. This is still pre-release Astro and things are bound to change.

I have just created a simple navigation bar. Nothing over the top. I have what I'm  referring to as Dashboard that takes you to the front page and links to my social sites. I want something I can modify just to get my head around the way Astros framework works.

## The Concept

To create a button that takes the user to the most recent post. I'll call it `Most Recent` for now. 
As soon as you press the button it'll take the array of post map them by publishDate and return from the array the first item.

Astro is a framework that blurs the lines between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They do this by creating a .astro file format that places all thre languages in the same file. In my opinon this seems extreamly intuitve and easy to keep track of everything component, page, and layout related. In addition built into .astro files it has what the developers are calling frontmatter. This is a way of running serverside code that is run before the page is rendered. Allowing you to pass details from file to file. More on that in a moment.

To start I have a plain markdown file with a bit of frontmatter giving us basic details about the page. What layout and component it's using, the title, publishDate, etc. 

Like so:
```
  layout: ../../layouts/BlogPost.astro
  setup: |
    import Author from '../../components/Author.astro'
  title: Most Recent Post Button... A Start
  publishDate: 16 JUL 2022   <-- //This is the date of the post of this post.
  name: Mark Spratt
  href: https://twitter.com/_Hopelezz
  description: A simple button, to navigate to the most recent post.
  tags: framework, astro, react, svelte, vue, solidjs, preact, alpine, lit, vanilla
```

This `publishDate` field is already used to sort all the posts by date to sort the posts. This bit of code was already supplied with the Blog template.

```js
  let allPosts = await Astro.glob('../pages/*.md');
  // sorts the blog posts by publishedDate
  allPosts = allPosts.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.frontmatter.publishDate).valueOf() - new Date(a.frontmatter.publishDate).valueOf());
```

This means the allPosts variable is an array of all posts objects (including frontmatter) that's already sorted. Making my job that much easier!

With a simple JavaScript I can call up the first item in the array.
```js
  let mostRecent = allPosts[0];
```

Now I have the data for the post just need to figure out how to link it.

Because the SideBar is a component in the index.html file I'll need to pass this property to the component.

I can do this by either passing in the whole post object or just single bits of information. 

```js
  <Sidebar mostRecent={mostRecent} />
```

In the component folder I have my SideBar with a unordered list of links to my social sites and the homepage. Lets copy one of those...

and here we are!

<!-- TODO: Fix the remainder of this post! -->
```html
  <a href={mostRecent.url}>Most Recent</a>
```


making the href property more concise.

> Update: I have since modified this by moving the fetch command inside a function of an api.astro file and splitting my blog into blog and book review folders. This is to make it easier to manage the blog and bookreview posts separately. When I need the props for my posts I import the function from the utils file and pass it to the `blogPosts` object.

```js
  import { getBlogPosts } from '../utils/api.astro';
  const blogPosts = await getBlogPosts(blogPosts);
```

> This has to be in an async function because it is a promise. It also has to be housed inside a .astro file since it's using Astro props to fetch the post routes.
