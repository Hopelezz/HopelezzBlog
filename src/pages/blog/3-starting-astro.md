## Motivation

At the time of writing this I'm 3 month into my `Web Development` journey. Details of what I'm capable of can be found here in my [About Me](aboutMe). If that link doesn't work I've either not created the page or a custom 404 Page... they're still under construction. See [Things I want to Do](#things-i-want-to-do) for more details. 

_Not gonna lie, I just learned how to make this link to a different header on the page._

```
[Things I want to Do](#things-i-want-to-do)
```

A description plus in the url part has to have #all-words-in-lower-case with hiphens between each words.

If you are struggling with the idea of `How To` for something like this I hope I can inspires you with this journey. Admittedly, I'm winging it...enjoying the process. If I break something I try to learn why it broke and how to fix it.

## What Frameworks Does This Site Use?

This is purely Astro at the time of writting this post. However, Astro natively supports every popular framework.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Solidjs](https://solidjs.com/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [Vanilla](https://www.javascript.com/)

Meaning, if I wanted to come back later and add anything specific I could with little to no issues!

This site started out with a basic [Blog template](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog?file=README.md). By comparing the two I hope just how drastically this site has changed.

## The Start

At the time of writing this I'm an Electrical Engineer. I love the type of work I do, but I see a figurative wall for growth.
Was listening one day to a Jordan Harbringer podcast on gaining wealth the discussion pertained to the idea of skill stacking. The idea is to take multiple disciplins and combine them to gain a unquie set of skills. 

I started into Software Development with the idea that I could modify Eplan to boost my personal productivity. Eplan is an electrical CAD. It's designed to simplify the process for creating electrical schematics. Eplan has the ability to run scripts that uses its Application Programming Interface (API). Knowing this I set out to learn C# the language of Eplan. 

Half way through my course on C# my lead and coworker quit. Leaving me the last electrical engineer on the team for a multi million dollar company. Taking over the department I had more on my plate than just a few scripts. I had been on the team for a little over a year and had been strugling to use the templates that had been created by my previous team. Just a month prior I had given a presentation for a new development process. Management approved!

Their departure gave me the clean slate to archive all the depricated templates, clean up the parts library, and create bring forward my new templates design scheme. This took roughly 3 months to complete along with the massive workload I had just been given. That sounds like a lot of time, but I had effectively shaved off a weeks worth of time per project, increase accuracy, and readability of the schematics. Half a year later my company finally hired new replacements. I was able to for the most part keep up with the pace of the company.

Towards the end of 2020, I was still spending my weekends slowly learning C#. Along the way I had my coworker telling me I should be looking into python. Took the bait to try and learn it. I was hooked! I quickly flew through the Code Academy course. The language felt natural to me. The only downside was that I had no real decernable direction on how to use it in my work.

## 100Devs

I would from time to time watch this programmer on Twitch called MidnightSimon. One evening he wasn't on so I went looking for some other streamer to watch. I stumbled onto a streamer who went by LearnWithLeon. He was talking about how to network and market yourself. This seemed to be exactly what I was looking for... except something seemed off. Leon was teaching Web Development. 

## A New Journey

Here I am, a newly minted Python programmer watching a course on how to get a job as a FullStack JavaScript Developer. A few classes later I finally caved in and started from class one on his youtube channel.

## Learn How To Learn

The first couple of classes were focused on learning how to learn and dealing with mental and physical health. This became pretty relavent when going through the course. Its set at a pretty decent pace, but the workload was heavy. I went into it knowing the basic software logics from my previous courses. 



<!-- 
The first post I wrote actually started back in 2011 as a facebook post. My mom asked me one morning "[What is a Password Vault](1-password)". Now we're here in 2022 creating a blog. I started programming about 2 years prior learning C#. Making some tournament tracker and a  Shortly after that my roomate & my Co-worker both suggested I start learning Python. I ran through the course. I love writting in python but had no decernable direction. It feels the most intuitive to me. I even created a [Card Game](https://replit.com/@Hopelezz/War?v=1) from scratch.

One evening on Twitch I stumbled on a bootcamp called #100Devs. An instructor who goes by the name Leon was teaching about JavaScript. Honestly, at first I was just going to use the platform to hustle my way into a job, but using python instead. That was until I saw the different projects that were being built. 

## Baby Steps

First thing I did was make a Logo! Sure, it's not tied directly to programming the blog or anything, but I wanted to set a theme around a `brand`. It's not a bran YET, but it could be. I still have to work on creating an SVG version of it. That'll come when I have some creative headroom. For now I'll be using a simple PNG.

>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It's a way to draw images that can be scaled, colored, and rotated.

## The Road

I wanted to add some flexibilty to my site. One thing it was missing was a navigation bar. So I created one! This is what it looked like originally:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/88TWvWO"  ><a href="//imgur.com/a/88TWvWO">Sidebar</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've since redesigned it, adding and removing features based on what I need.

For the icons I used this website [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/). You can search over 1600 icons. You can even use the icons as fonts! Because of this I was able to rather easily modify the CSS of the icons.

I also added search (that doesn't work yet. I head that's hard...), -->
