### _Politics, Dystopic, World View, Communist_

> **Disclaimer:** If you are going to judge something you should at least understand the intent. I doubt Marx or Engels had any ill intent upon the creation of this Manifesto. I do, however, believe they were wholly ignorant of the true nature of the thing in which they were creating.
> <br/>
> Another thing is the stigma that surrounds certain political pieces. Almost as if one were to touch them you'd be tainted.
> <br/>
> I once read an introduction to Mein Kompf by Abraham Foxman that said:
> "We preserve Mein Kompf in this spirit of remembering; we study it in the hope of securing a brighter future for humanity."

I came to this book out of sheer interest for Dystopic and those interests started with a book called "Brave New World" back in my late teens. Since then I have admired, probably out of grotesque interests, the concepts hidden within these stories. Due to this personal intrigue, I have since read several pieces on the origin of the topic dating back to Utopia by Sir Thomas More. I say all this because I believe the very essence of Communism is one of utopic vision.

## The Book

Marx aims to explain the beliefs of the Communist party and its League. The first thing the reader is addressed with is a history of class struggles.

I was discussing this with my friend after having read the book. He said:
> "Communism is a concept that isn't inherent in humans, one that has to be forced."
