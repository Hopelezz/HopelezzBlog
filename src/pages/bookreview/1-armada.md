# Book Review:

## Armada by Ernest Cline
10/10
Sci-fi, Thriller, Action packed, Aliens

Brief Description: Armada is about a guy named Zack Lightman, who is daydreaming in class staring out the classroom window and sees an alien spaceship… the same ship from the same video game he’s been playing for 3 years. Comes to realize that the powers that be have been preparing the world to help defend against an Alien invasion for years. Zack’s personal story will have you in a whirl of emotions and engaged through the entire story.

Even though I had read Ready Player One with a fervor, I approached Armada with some skepticism. How could Cline possibly top his previous book? With Armada of course. I read this book in 3 days; which is a record for myself. Alright, that's a bit subjective I'll admit owing to that fact that I have an obsession with a series of books known by its first book Ender's Game. Ender’s Game is written by Orson Scott Card. A while back I had read that Card wrote his book for his children so he kept it on the less gritty side. Armada is an adult version of Ender’s Game, not so much as gore, but sheer intensity. Armada pays homage to Card’s book and even references it in Armada. Ender is about a boy who tests out to be one of the brightest kids in the world and chosen to defend earth with his critical thinking skills.
While Armada has a few of the key elements Enders uses, it’s no carbon copy by any means.

The way Cline builds his world is unique. By referring to pop culture Cline brings up all those emotions the reader ties to those titles. All while telling this story through the eyes of the main character. As if you're in conversation with someone and they're telling you a genuinely incredible story. All while using examples you are familiar with to add further depth to their story. Every one of the artifacts Cline mentions made me feel the need to research them or listen to the songs just to further delve into the world in which Clines was building. A scattering of hidden eggs can be found throughout the book. Oh, and the ending? The ending… on second thought, I’ll just let you read it for yourself. I was in awe.
