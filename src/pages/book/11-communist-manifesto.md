### _Politics, Dystopic, World View, Communist_

> **Disclaimer:** If you are going to judge something you should at least understand the intent. I doubt Marx or Engels had any ill intent upon the creation of this Manifesto. I do, however, believe they were wholly ignorant to the true nature to the thing in which they were creating. 
> <br/>
> Another thing is the stigma that surrounds certain political pieces. Almost as if one were to touch them they'd be tainted.

> I once read an introduction to Mein Kampf by Abraham Foxman that said:
> "We preserve Mein Kampf in this spirit of remembering; we study it in the hope of securing a brighter future for humanity."

I came to this book out of sheer interest for Dystopics. I started with a book called "Brave New World". Since then I have admired, probably out of grotesque interest, the concepts hidden within these stories. Due to this personal intrigue I have since read several pieces on the origin of the topic dating back to Utopia by Sir Thomas More.
