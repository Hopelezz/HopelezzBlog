### _Sci-fi, Thriller, Action-packed, Aliens, Ender's-Game-Clone_

Armada is about a guy named Zack Lightman, who is daydreaming out a window in class and sees an alien spaceship. The same ship from a video game he’s been playing for 3 years. He comes to realize that the powers-that-be have been preparing the world to defend against an Alien invasion for years. Zack’s personal story will have you in a whirl of emotions and engaged through the entire story.

>I'd spent my entire life overdosing on uncut escapism, willingly allowing fantasy to become my reality.

Even though I had read Ready Player One with a fervor, I approached Armada with some skepticism. _How could Cline top his previous book?_ With Armada of course. I read this book in 3 days; which is a record for myself. I have an obsession with a book series written by Orson Scott Card known as Ender Series.  Ender is about a boy who tests out to be one of the brightest kids in the world and is chosen to defend earth with his critical thinking skills. A while back I had read that Card wrote the books for his children so he kept it on the less gritty side. Armada is an adult version of Ender’s Game (The first in the series), not so much gore, but sheer intensity. Armada pays homage to Card’s books and even references it in Armada. While Armada has a few of the key elements Enders uses, it’s no carbon copy by any means.

Cline uses pop culture to immerse the reader in nostalgia all while telling a story through the eyes of the main character. It's almost as if you're in conversation with someone telling an incredible story. Every artifact Cline mentions that I didn't know made me want to research them or listen to the songs. A scattering of hidden eggs can be found throughout the book. Oh, and the ending? The ending… on second thought, I’ll let you read it for yourself. I was in awe.
