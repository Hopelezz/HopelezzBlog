### _American Science Fiction, Military Fiction_


Slaughterhouse-Five is one of those books that you either love or hate. I happen to love it. It's a masterpiece of satire, science fiction, and anti-war literature. It tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time and travels back and forth between different moments of his life, from his childhood to his death. Along the way, he witnesses the horrors of World War II, especially the firebombing of Dresden, gets abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, and learns to see time as a fourth dimension.

The book is full of humor, irony, and absurdity. It challenges the notions of free will, causality, and morality. It exposes the futility and cruelty of war and violence. It questions the meaning and value of life and death. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time. It's a book that stays with you long after you finish it.

One of the most memorable aspects of the book is the way it uses repetition. The phrase "so it goes" appears 106 times in the book, whenever someone or something dies. It's a way of expressing acceptance and resignation to the inevitable. It's also a way of mocking the pretentiousness and hypocrisy of human civilization. As Kurt Vonnegut writes in the introduction: "There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."

Another recurring motif is the phrase "and so on". It's a way of showing how trivial and mundane most of human history and culture is. It's also a way of implying that there is more to the story than what is told. As Billy Pilgrim says: "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true."

The book also uses quotes from other sources to create contrast and irony. For example, when Billy Pilgrim watches a war movie backwards, he hears a verse from the Sermon on the Mount: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." This is followed by another quote from an American general: "We're not going to let a bunch of goddamn weaklings take over this country." The juxtaposition of these two quotes highlights the hypocrisy and absurdity of war and religion.

Another example is when Billy Pilgrim reads a book by Kilgore Trout, a fictional science fiction writer who appears in several of Vonnegut's novels. The book is called The Gospel from Outer Space and it tells a different version of the life of Jesus Christ. In this version, Jesus is not the son of God but an ordinary man who tries to deliver a message of peace and love to humanity. However, he is rejected and crucified by the people who misunderstand him. The aliens from Tralfamadore then visit Earth and reveal that Jesus was actually a messenger from them. They also explain that they have been observing human history for a long time and they have concluded that humans are a mistake. They decide to destroy Earth and all its inhabitants.

This quote from the book sums up its message: "The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn if he could why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of their trouble was slipshod storytelling in their holy book."

Slaughterhouse-Five is not a conventional novel. It does not follow a linear plot or a coherent structure. It does not have a clear moral or message. It does not offer any solutions or answers. It does not even have a proper ending. It simply presents a series of events that happen to Billy Pilgrim and leaves it up to the reader to make sense of them.

I think that's what makes it so powerful and unique. It's a book that challenges you to think for yourself and to question everything you know and believe. It's a book that makes you feel alive and aware of your own existence in this crazy world.

I give it 9 out of 10 stars.
