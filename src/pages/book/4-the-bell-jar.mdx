_This book could be a trigger for those who deal with <u>suicidal tendencies</u>._

Reading The Bell Jar, I felt the pathos that are heavily inlaid into the story of this semi-autobiographical novel and it melted my heart.

>“It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.”

And thus the tale of Esther Greenwood, our Protagonist, begins. The book covers her struggles through relationships, abuse, and the pressure of an adult life, encapsulated through the lens of teen angst. All to the point she starts to suffocate and spiral out of control. Forced into therapy, but it goes horribly wrong. 

I would love to tell you about different details about the book past this point, but I can’t for fear I would be devoiding you of the same ambivalent feeling in which I was consumed with.

Or in Esther’s own words:
>“I felt very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.”

I’ve come to the conclusion I’m not fond much of teen angst because it only translates to me as "snooty". Mind you, my feelings were just my experience with the characters in this Novel and Catcher in the Rye, which I read back to back. Many others have found both novels amusing in a seriocomic sort of way. Anyhow, please give this book a serious look as you’re deciding on which book to read next!
