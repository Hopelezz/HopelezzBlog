# Rating: 7/10
### _Fiction, Psychological, Suspense_

The book starts with a compelling narrative. It'll suck you in, but right after it shifts drastically to some boring guys' (Flynn) life. He's an author, writing about a supermarket. For the most part, the story is bland day-to-day nonsense, but with insights into his thoughts on writing his novel. 

It's very much like Fight Club in the way to story plays out, but with twists like Flynn breaking the 4th wall or retelling events as if they happened when they're all in his head. This gave the story a fresh take. I very much like the 2nd half of the book more as this is when the story starts getting fleshed out and changes narrative mindsets. 

For the most part, it's a solid book for a new author.
